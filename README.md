# Movies_ETL

## Purpose

- The purpose of this analysis was to use the extract, transfrom, load method in python to prepare movie and ratings data from multiple different sources for a hackathon that was taking place in the near future. The cleaning of this data will ensure that the results at the hackathon are the best possible results and there will be little to no deviations. Using python I extracted and cleaned the CSV and JSON files, created dataframes, merged dataframes, and created new databases in SQL to query from.
